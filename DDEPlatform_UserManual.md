### Deep-time Engine
Deep-time Engine is the cornerstone of DDE Platform. It contains four level of sub-engines, which corresponds to computing, data, knowledge, and research services respectively. These services support cases in different geoscientific fields.

### Data Service
Geology data is abundant, but not all of them is accessible or utilized efficiently. It is scattered around the world, it may be on a page in a library book, it may be in the records of a laboratory instrument, or it may be in the storage of a personal computer. If these scattered and long-tailed data are not connected and aggregated, it is difficult to understand the evolution of the earth and reveal the laws of the earth's evolution.

The DDE platform promotes the construction of a global geological data network that conforms to the FAIR principle by establishing data discovery and connection supported by the central concept, and expressing global geological data through a unified DDE meta-standard. At the same time, establish a user-centered data share system, utilize and break through new information technology, realize the explosive growth of data, make data flow on the platform and among users, form a virtuous circle, and truly realize the sharing of global geoscience data. 

The data nodes linked by the DDE hub can be retrieved, browsed, calculated, managed, and shared by users of the platform according to the different openness of the data, and also supports the collaboration of multiple users to complete data production.

### Knowledge Service
DDE's governance of knowledge mainly consists of two products of big knowledge, namely GAKG and GPKG. GAKG is a multimodal knowledge graph formed by extracting knowledge from global geoscience literature and manually annotating it. GPKG is a platform for knowledge content editing by professional geoscientists around the world. 

With top-down expert knowledge editing and bottom-up literature knowledge extraction, DDE Platform provides one-stop geoscience knowledge service to provide users with global shared and co-constructed geoscience knowledge. This geoscientific knowledge will better guide users to conduct scientific research, and also provide raw materials for knowledge-based scientific research (such as artificial intelligence).

### Computing Service
Computing resources are the basis of data-driven geological analysis. DDE provides global geoscience scientists with fair, convenient and powerful online geoscience computing services through Deep-time Engine, which includes:
- Globally accessible cloud infrastructure services through DDE Cloud;
- Abundant geoscience analysis tool and workflow services;
- Large-scale, high-performance geoscience computing services.

Through the above three-level services, geoscience researchers can use DDE's computing resources, models and workflows to complete their own scientific research through efficient online computing and analysis capabilities, and obtain the research and analysis results they want.
### Scene-oriented Service
Based on Deep-time Engine's computing services, data services, knowledge services and flexible assembly capabilities, DDE platform can quickly create a customized working platform for complex scientific research and analysis scenarios with service APIs and browser components. We’ve already created several working platforms, such as the Paleogeography Platform and the GlobalLayer Platform.

# Modules
## Resources

The Resources helps you discover abundant and continuously updated geoscience data, knowledge and analysis tools of our overall DDE open network. Users can search via keywords and standard geologic time, and get more information about the resource via the button "more".

In Addition, you would notice a specific part in Data Hub called Light Up Node. Here we want to provide you with data catalog with specific topics from internet, or you can regard it as a store with various data sites from Internet. We collect data sites spread all over the world, as long as they are online, so that you can browse and search these PURE data sites, which is hard to achieve through normal search engines. This process is like we are lighting up the data hidden in the corners of the Internet, hence we call it Light Up Node. If possible, these nodes will join our Data Network, and serve you with more features.

### Analysis

The MyDDE Analysis is a convenient option for computing on the data provided by the DDE Platform. The Analysis module includes three sections: workflow task, code task and map. Workflow task will provide workflow in the low code forms. Combined with the data and model integrated by the platform, it will provide users with a simple and easy to operate multi-functional geographic information processing method, and has the ability of batch processing. Code task will provide a Jupyter hub deployment that includes a set of commonly used packages for geospatial and sustainability data analysis. Map can save all kinds of layers and data as a project, which is convenient for users to call quickly and continue their previous work.

Workflow task can save the workflow generated by users, which is convenient for users to view, clone and delete. Users can view the workflow created in the past and make changes, or clone a new Workflow with the same content on the existing Workflow. In addition, users will also intuitively see the running state of each workflow.

<figure>
 <center><img src="./usermanual_figures/MyDDE-Analysis_fig1.png" alt="my alt text"/></center>
 <figcaption align="center">Figure 1. Overview of Workflow Task.</figcaption>
</figure>


Code task contains all personal workspaces created by users. Users can create, enter, pause and delete code tasks. At the same time, users will also intuitively view the number of resources occupied by each code task and the percentage of resources used in the upper limit of resources.

During the creation process, the user needs to determine the name, CPU resource size, memory resource size and other parameters of the created code task. After the creation, you can click enter to enter the code task, write and run the code, and obtain the desired processing results. Jupyter Lab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, Geoscientific computing, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality. Now, we can use it in MyDDE Code Task.
